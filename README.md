# check-weather

## Description

- I love making weather applications because of the vast amount of ways you can format it the the multiple uses an API can have.
- I chose to create a weather dashboard because it displays my working knowledge in and ability to call on a semi-advanced API 
- I desided to create a weather dashboard because I wanted to challange my current understanding of API work flow and implement it in a practical way
- By making this page, how to apply a call by call API and implement units at scale
